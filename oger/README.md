# oger.apps.renci.org

Basic Helm instructions for a Docker image of [OGER](https://github.com/OntoGene/OGER/)
running with a similar ontology setup to
[Omnicorp](https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/omnicorp). We should increase the memory 
if we need to test this for speed, but the current settings are fine for general
testing of OGER.

Once started, this will be accessible at https://oger.apps.renci.org/ from within
the RENCI network.
